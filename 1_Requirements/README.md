## Introduction
#### Title: Computation Transmission Parameters in Power System
This project helps to calculate the Transmission Line parameters(A,B,CD) when given with some input data containing voltage, length of Transmission Line etc. Display the total line parameters and also the Efficiency of the line including voltage regulation values. This parameter helps out the engineer to know about the working of transmission system to reduce losses and construct the transmission line in a much faster pace with high efficiency and reliability.

## Defining Our System
  ### Objectives:
  - Compute transmission line parameters for short transmission system
  - Compute transmission line parameters for Medium transmission system using Nominal pi Model
  - Compute transmission line parameters for Long transmission system assuming resistance of the system as zero
  ### Explaination:
   For Transmission lines it takes more time for calculating the sending end voltage to finally get the efficiency manually.This project helps the customer to re-design their transmission system with higher efficiency by simply puting their design values in this project and taking out the efficiency.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
- Transco and Distribution companies whose main focus on constructing Transmission lines

## What:
- Many Transmission Line are inefficient due to prolonged time for testing the efficiency of the transmission line manually.This project gives the oopurtunity to compute all the required parameters and deploy into real world with more efficiency

## When:
- With the increasing population demand for Electric power also increased exponentially.
- With the increase in power demand,increased the problem to design the efficient transmision system to reduce the power loss

## Where:
- This problem is surfaced in all states of India

## How:
- This project takes in all the design input values and yields out the Line parameters.
